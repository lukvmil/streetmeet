# StreetMeet

StreetMeet is social platform designed to facilitate real, physical interaction rather than keeping people on the platform.

### Here's how it works:
1. When you load the web app, type in a nickname and a conversation topic you want to talk about.
2. After pressing submit, it will ask you for location. This will be used to match you with other users and won't be shared.
3. Now you will be able to see a list of potential conversations with users in a 5 mile radius.
4. Click on the "message" button to initiate or respond to a chat.
5. The idea is to make new friends in your local area! None of the data is saved between sessions, so it encourages people to move off of the platform and meet up to continue the conversation in real life.
